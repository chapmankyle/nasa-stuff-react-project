<img src="https://github.com/chapmankyle/nasa-stuff-react-project/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg" />

A game where you guess the planet based on a single image, or search the NASA database of images :rocket:

## Setup :hammer:

Firstly, you need Node.js version 16 or above. If you do not have Node.js installed, you can follow the download instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current).

To get the project set up, you need to clone the repo and install the dependencies by following these commands:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/chapmankyle/nasa-stuff-react-project.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd nasa-stuff-react-project/

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

Everything should now be setup :tada:

## Run Locally :runner:

To run the project locally, the only command you need to run is:
```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you should now see a page that is similar to below.

## Build :globe_with_meridians:

To build the project for a production environment, the only command you need to run is:
```bash
npm run build
```

You should now see a `dist` folder with the minified project.

## Test :test_tube:

To test the project, the only command you need to run is:
```bash
npm run test
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see a message saying "All tests passed".
